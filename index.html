        <h2>Liberty Property Trust</h2>
        <p>With this client, I developed a pre-designed marketing platform on the Marcom platform. This project was
            enjoyable
            because the clients pushed early on to have a fun marketing portal that all their employees would like
            to use, and that is easy to order their marketing materials. While the platform was a little restricting
            (ie, no
            Javascript allowed, with
            pre-styled elements that I couldnâ€™t touch), I was able to learn how to code within those restrictions
            and deliver a unique and beautiful portal.

        </p>

            <h3>Homepage</h3>
            <p>The client wanted an easy to use faux-modal that had the top four products ordered at that time. Next,
                the
                discover products section was tabbed so the user could look into the five sections and decide which
                product they needed quickly.</p>

        <div class="inner__wrapper">
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>The Events page was very similar to the Homepage with the box on top with Event-specific marketing
                materials. Everything else is in a grid to make it responsive and clean.</p>

        <div class="inner__wrapper">
            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>On this page, the client wanted an easy to use carousel with arrows that have some questions and answers
                to help the marketing user quickly. The carousel was one of the biggest challenges for me since I was
                unable to use Javascript on this platform I needed to find another way to code it. Unfortunately, we did
                have to make some sacrifices on design: on the carousel, I was unable to rotate the photos, so we just
                rotated the text and left the photo stationery.
